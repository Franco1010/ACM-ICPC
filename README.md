## What is this?
A repository along whit a [wiki](https://github.com/Franco1010/ACM-ICPC/wiki) for students interested in ICPC or simply competitive programming

Post your solutions, libraries, guides, tutorials, or anything you think is helpful.

I publish here my accepted submissions to ACM ICPC training and related sites with competitive programming

## Getting started

 1. Read the [wiki](https://github.com/Franco1010/ACM-ICPC/wiki), anyone can edit the wiki
 2. In the folders above you can find solved problems of different online judges (wiki)
 3. Also you can find books and algorithms that we have found useful in contests
 4. And most important, you can help adding to this repository your algorithms, books, tips, or your own solutions for any problem in any judge that is not already in the repository

#### Contributing
- You will have to fork it and send a pull request.
- If you have no idea what any of that means, read through the tutorials at http://help.github.com.
- Bonus points if you explain how you solved the problem

## [Resources](https://github.com/Franco1010/ACM-ICPC/tree/master/ACM-ICPC/RPC)
Here you cand find some books, algorithms, notes, and theory in general that you can use to prepare yourself for the ACM-ICPC. You can have all the print documents that you want in a contest, so you're allowed to print all the material that you found usefull here and use for your training or in the contests, is up to you.
